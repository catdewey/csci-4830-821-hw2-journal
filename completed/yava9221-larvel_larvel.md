## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-02-29
*   Completed: 2016-02-29

The non-technical work took about 10 minutes. I already knew of an open source project that I use.
The technical work took about an hour; originally I wanted to see if I could make a minor change to their code, 
but that ended up taking a lot more time than I would have liked. I ended up checking for grammer in the readme file.


## The Change

I changed the sentence flow in a section of the readme.md file by taking out a word because it was redundant.

*   2016-02-29: I use Laravel, which is a PHP web app framework, for some work I do. Since it is open source, it didn't take me long
                to find a project that I wanted to work on.
