\
## Timeline\
\
*   Started: 2016-02-29\
*   Completed: in progress\
\
There was comparatively little technical work. I spent most of my time looking for an interesting project, and then getting distracted by the awesome open source things that I didn\'92t know existed. \
I also spent some time pursuing another issue from another project, before deciding that that repository was not as active as I needed. \
\
## The Change\
\
There were a few style things that I wanted to correct. \
\
## Progress\
\
*   2016-02-28: Repository found, and some style things are not consistent with other style.  \
\
*   2016-02-29: Pull request submitted. \
