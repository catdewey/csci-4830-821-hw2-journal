## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-02-29
*   Completed: TBD

The majority of the time spend was going through github and trying to find
somehting to contribute on that wasn't totally over my head. After looking
through various programs on cryptology and password cracking that seeemed
a little over the top I decided on this repo.

## The Change

I wanted to make a couple changes to the wording in the README as the first
time reading through I couldn't really follow.

## Progress

*   2016-03-01: Forked the repo and made the changes I wanted to make.
		Submitted a pull request to the ownder and now waiting
		for confirmation.
